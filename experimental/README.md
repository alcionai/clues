The experimental package and subpackages contain features that are undergoing
development. Features in these packages may undergo breaking changes as we find
the best solution to the problem at hand.

Moving something out of the experimental tree requires two things:
* feature APIs becoming (relatively) stable
* users of said features having enough time to switch to stable APIs outside the
  experimental subtree prior to deprecation of the experimental API
