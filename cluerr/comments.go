// an error message describe what that error really means. Even a bunch of
// clues  to describe system state may not be enough.  Sometimes what you need
// in order to debug the situation is a long-form explanation (you do already
// add that to your code, don't you?).  Or, even better, a linear history of
// long-form explanations, each one building on the prior (which you can't
// easily do in code).
//
// Unlike other additions, which are added as top-level key:value pairs to the
// context, the whole history of comments gets retained, persisted in order of
// appearance and prefixed by the file and line in which they appeared. This
// means comments are always added to the error and never clobber each other,
// regardless of their location.
